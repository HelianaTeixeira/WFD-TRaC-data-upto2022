## Overview of WFD TraC Biological QE data extracted from WISE4

This script provides an overview of the data extracted on the biological classifications (EQS for BQE from WISE-4), for both TRaC water categories (TW & CW). 

### 2. Import data extracted from the WISE4 available for TraC Waters
```{r get TraC WFD data}
#import the BQE data for TRaC
WFDdatTRaC <- readRDS(file = here("Data","dat_WFD_TRaC.rds")) #TRaC water categories
```

### 3. Explore WISE4 data extracted for TraC Waters
```{r explore TraC WFD data}
#check years with BQE data for TRaC
levels(as.factor(WFDdatTRaC$cYear))
```
