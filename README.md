## WFD-TRaC-data-upto2022
Assembling Water Quality data from: 

* WISE4 (identifier: eea_wise-wfd_s) WFD Biological Quality Elements (EQS) (2000 to 2020; incl. 2010 and 2016);
* WISE2 (identifier: eea_waterbase-biology_s) EEA Waterbase – Biology (normalised EQR) (1990 to 2022);
* WISE6 (identifier: eea_waterbase-water-quality-icm_s) WFD Water Quality Supporting Elements (1899 to 2022).

(All data sources above were assessed by December 2023).

This work was developed within the Water Framework Directive (WFD) Common Implementation Strategy, under the ECOSTAT Working Group. This repository contains the files necessary to assemble Biological and Supporting Quality Elements data from the EU MS national reporting obligations for the WFD. The resulting data will be used to evalute current national boundaries to support good ecological status and to derived methods to improve the current BPG Toolkit. The ultimate goals is to update the Best Practice Guide and help Member States adjusting and deriving their boundaries as they see fit.
