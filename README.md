# ECOSTAT - Water Quality Data

## WFD-TRaC-data-upto2022
Assembling Water Quality data from: 

* WISE4 WFD Biological Quality Elements (EQS), 
* WISE6 WFD Water Quality Supporting Elements.

(All data sources above were assessed before October 2022).

This work was developed within the Water Framework Directive (WFD) Common Implementation Strategy, under the ECOSTAT Working Group. This repository contains the files necessary to assemble Biological and Supporting elements data from the EU MS national reporting obligations for the WFD. The resulting data will be used to evalute current national boundaries to support good ecological status and to derived methods to improve the current BPG Toolkit. The ultimate goals is to help Member States adjusting and deriving their boundaries as they see fit.
